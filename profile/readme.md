## ‚ö°Ô∏è About:

**[GhostFi](https://app.ghostfi.xyz/)** is a **SocialFi** app built for degens users. Inspired by [friend.tech](https://www.friend.tech/), users can invest **$GHOST** in X creators. 

The price of **$GHOST** will mimic the quality of the content provided by the creator to his community. If the quality of the content increases so that the community's fan base grows, this will be reflected in the price of a **$GHOST** to join. On the contrary, if the creator fails to meet the expectations of his audience, the price of the **$GHOST** will probably drop. If, for whatever reason, the **$GHOST**'s price doesn't seem to reflect its fair value, it's up to buyers to judge whether factors such as speculation have anything to do with it.

As **[GhostFi.xyz](https://app.ghostfi.xyz/)**'s aim is to create a virtuous circle of creativity, royalties are set up for both the creator and the creator's current **$GHOST** holders. Each time a **$GHOST** is bought or sold, in addition to the transaction price, a fee is charged to the buyer or seller to pay the royalties. This means that there is no artificial inflation of demand or prices for **$GHOST**s, as royalty payments are guaranteed by actual fees.
